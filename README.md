# Silent Auction

Once you are done with your bid, the program asks if there are any other bidders. If so, the screen clears and you can handover the laptop to the next person who's going to make their bid. 
If everybody is done, type 'no' to the question and the program is going to add up all the bids and figure out who bid the highest and give us a winner!
